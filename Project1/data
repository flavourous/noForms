Possibly linked to that, when draggng the tracker, its weird.  it imideatly shifts when you hlick the trackbar.. and it seems sticky near the ends.  Ofsetts are ok tho it looks like... starts dragging again at the same Y coord each time.  cant drag all way to top either - it seems that when out of bounds offsets are set, they just get discarded instead of bounded.&#xA;&#xA;update: Working, but tests givin problems where container lights up when form location not 0,0 when clicking on up or down arrows...&#xA;&#xA;That scrolls to show everything when outside of clip area.&#xA;&#xA;Im getting a lot of stories now, so i need it!&#xA;&#xA;Need for list select box, hence drop box too!&#xA;&#xA;This will affect the clipped Event arg I want to add, because the check will depend on the scroll offsets...  ... ugh.&#xA;&#xA;Also, system.drawing has a nice transform property, but the d2d transform is a 2x3 matrix? dont know what the values are for.  rotations too probabbly.
